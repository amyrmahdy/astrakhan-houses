**The relevance of the work**. The analysis of real estate prices is relevant for both businesses and individuals who are going to buy or sell real estate. Various methods of statistical analysis can be used to analyze real estate prices. One of the promising methods of statistical analysis is cluster analysis.

In the real estate market, various types of real estate are sold and bought, among which there are traditionally categories: residential real estate and commercial real estate. Different types of real estate have different characteristics, therefore, for statistical analysis it is advisable to identify a fairly homogeneous variety of real estate properties. In this paper, for the statistical analysis of prices, such a variety of residential real estate as apartments was chosen.
The purpose of the work. The purpose of this work is to model the prices of apartments in the city of Astrakhan using cluster analysis.

Taking into account the fact that programming using a language with a variety of libraries for data collection and analysis is necessary for processing large amounts of data, Python was chosen as the programming language and the following tasks were set to achieve the goal:

- determine the typical characteristics indicated in the ads for the sale of apartments on the market;
- Implement a program in Python to automatically collect data from apartment ads from a real estate website;
- to collect data on apartment prices and their characteristics in the city of Astrakhan;
- implement a program in Python for statistical analysis of apartment prices depending on their characteristics;
- identify the factors that most significantly affect the price of an apartment;
    perform modeling of apartment prices using cluster analysis.

The **object** of the study is the modeling of real estate prices.

The **subject** of the study is the use of cluster analysis for modeling real estate prices.

The **hypothesis** of the study is the assumption about the possibility of modeling apartment prices using cluster analysis.
